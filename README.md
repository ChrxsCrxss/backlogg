“BackLOGG”

Website designed for programmers and coders to anonymously gossip about their software engineering jobs and coworkers. Social platform that allows users to:
sign up
log in
make posts
make comments on posts.
rate posts by their “spiciness” level. 
Every user can make a profile, every profile should have a picture/avatar uploaded. (default profile pic if a custom one is not uploaded)

Each user’s profile contains a history of that user’s posts, and a main-page newsfeed composed of posts from other users. Each profile also contains the following information about the user: username (required). You can also add a company, profile photo, and a profile bio. You can also control who sees the profile info.

The newsfeed is filtered; all posts become invisible 48 hours after posting, and posts from non-friends are also invisible. Posts consist of text posted by the original user, spicy level indicators, and comments made by other users. “Spicy Level'' is indicated by a jalapeno symbol on the post, and each commenter can increase or decrease the spicy level by clicking “Spicy!” or “Mild.” options, respectively. Once a commenter has rated a post hot or not, they cannot rate that post again. Every five “Hot!” ratings increases the spicy level by one rank, up to a max of rank 5 (25 Spicy votes). Every “Mild.” vote cancels out a “Spicy!” vote 1-to-1, so every 5 “Mild.” votes will decrease the spicy rank.
